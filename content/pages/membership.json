Your resume will be required.\n* For the technical portion, we test on material up through what is expected to be completed by Fall quarter of the inductee’s second year. Refer to your sample four-year plan([https://plans.ucsd.edu](https://plans.ucsd.edu \"https://plans.ucsd.edu\")) to view the minimum coursework we expect.\n\nThe **HKN (Kappa Psi) Induction Ceremony** is a ceremony declaring and celebrating your membership into Eta Kappa Nu, held during one evening at the UC San Diego Campus. This ceremony is mandatory to officially induct into HKN.\n\nA one-time membership fee of $90 is required to induct into HKN Kappa Psi. This fee must be paid by the night of the Induction Ceremony, and covers the costs of the ceremony, HKN and IEEE membership, and T-shirt.\n\n## Timeline\n\n***\n\nEvery year, HKN inducts two classes of inductees from two induction cycles: the Fall-Winter Cycle, and the Winter-Sprint Cycle. Invitations for each cycle are sent out during Fall and Winter quarter, respectively.\n\nHere is a general timeline for each cycle:\n\n| **Fall-Winter Cycle** |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n",

You need to complete the 10 points by the day of the induction ceremony. However, note that you need to complete 6 points by winter (fall-winter cycle) / spring break (winter-spring cycle) in order to be eligible for interviews.\n\n***\n\nAny further questions?
