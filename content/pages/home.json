Members consist of students, alumni, and professionals who have demonstrated exceptional academic and professional accomplishments. Student members are selected on the basis of scholastic standing, character, and leadership. Through a variety of service programs and leadership training, student members develop lifelong skills that earmark them for prominent positions in industry and academia. Members are much better prepared for the post-college world and are especially valuable and attractive to employers. They are recognized as extremely capable, both technically and professionally.\n\n \n\nTo further recognize excellence, HKN conducts award programs to recognize professional leaders, exceptional educators, outstanding students, young ECE professionals, outstanding chapters, and effective faculty advisors.\n\n \n\nAfter graduation, members continue their HKN involvement through their university chapters, volunteering for HKN committees and receiving information on HKN activities.\n\n \n\nFor more than 100 years, Eta Kappa Nu has embraced excellence. In the years ahead, HKN will continue to reinvent itself to meet the needs of its 200,000+ members, the institutions they serve, and our overall society.\n\nCredit: [HKN Headquarters](https://hkn.ieee.org)\n\n***\n\n## Our Sponsors\n\n***\n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to the following sponsors:",
